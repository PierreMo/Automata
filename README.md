Automata Project

Our code is in Python 3.12
To use our project as a library for automatas you just need automat.py and state.py, without any library
To use our project with its interface you need to install the libraries: customtkinter, pillow, colorama. And then lunch menu.py

Our code allow to
-	Read a FA from a text file, displaying it
- Knowing if a FA is: deterministic? deterministic and complete? Standard?
- Obtain a standardized FA of another
- Obtain a determinized FA of another
- Obtain a minimized FA of another
- Know if a given word is recognized by an FA
- Create the complentary automata of another
- Additional features: writing automatas in file, creating automatas with methods

Our Project do NOT deal with Asynchronous automatas
